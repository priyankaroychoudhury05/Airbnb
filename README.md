# EDA using Airbnb data
An exploratory data analysis using the Inside Airbnb open datasets on listings and calendar using python libraries.

## Project description
The aim of the project is to help me imporve my data science skills by answering some questions with the Airbnb dataset which I am interested to answer. I have tied this down to a personal interest to plan my trip to visit my brother in New York city.

## Questions that are answered through the analysis

1. Which neighbourhoods have the most listings in NYC?
2. How do prices of listings vary by neighbourhood?
3. Is living near tourist attractions going to cost me lot?
4. Should I choose to go with a listing where the host is a superhost?
5. Does it matter what time of the year, month or week I decide to visit NYC when it comes to accommodation prices?
